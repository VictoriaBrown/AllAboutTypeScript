# Instructions

#### Explore styling and data binding in an Angular application by styling the App component. Complete the following tasks:

Add 3 more properties to the app.component.ts file and then bind them to the app.component.html file using the same syntax as the title property.

:city_sunrise:City - the city you live in. 

:squirrel:Tag line - Make up a tag line (think super hero programmer).

:trollface:About Me - a quick paragraph about you.

Style each element with at least 2 CSS attributes. You can use the same attributes for all three properties but must have a total of 4 unique CSS attributes.
font size, coloring, position, transform, etc.
