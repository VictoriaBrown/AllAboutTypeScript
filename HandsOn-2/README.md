:heart: Requirements :heart:

Create a new class named Entry. The Entry class should implement the Person interface created in the previous Hands-On. It should have values for the following:
* a firstName value
* a lastName value
* a valid date for birthday :birthday:

Create a generic function. This function should take in any type of array and sort it, the way in which it is sorted is up to you. (e.g., ascending, descending, length)
Create a decorator. The decorator should format the birthday given in the class to the format of July 12, 1993.

Class The Person interface was properly implemented in a class.
Generic The generic function was implemented properly and sorts arrays of all types.
